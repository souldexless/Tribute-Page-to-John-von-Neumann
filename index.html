    <ul>
      <li>In <strong>1911</strong>, János was admitted to Fasori Evangélikus Gimnázium. Here his mathematical talent was quickly spotted by his teacher. </li>
      <li>In <strong>1928</strong>, Neumann started his career as a privatdozent at the University of Berlin. In the same year, he published ‘ZurTheorie der Gesellschaftsspiele’ (On the Theory of Parlor Games), an important paper in the field of game theory.</li>
      <li>In October 1929, he was invited to lecture on quantum theory at the Princeton University in New Jersey, USA. He accepted the offer; but since he was engaged to be married, he first went to Budapest to complete the ceremony and then moved to USA with his wife.</li>
      <li>In <strong>1933</strong>, the Institute of Advance Study was established at Princeton. Neumann became one of the six original Professors in Mathematics at the institute, a position he maintained throughout his life. In the same year, he also became co-editor of the ‘Annals of Mathematics.’</li>
      <li>In late <strong>1943</strong>, he was invited to join the Manhattan Project.  At Manhattan, Neumann mainly worked on the explosive lenses, which are capable of compressing the plutonium core of the ‘Fat Man’, the nuclear bomb that was dropped on Nagasaki. He not only provided the concept, but also contributed to its design. Later as the committee was set up to choose the target cities, Neumann was inducted in it.</li>
      <li>In <strong>1954</strong>, Neumann was elected a member of the Atomic Energy Commission. He served in that capacity till 1956. During this period, he worked to develop the policy of nuclear deterrence for President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s administration.</li>
